Python port of the R package [artpack](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=artpack), bringing generative art color palettes to the Python ecosystem.

## About

artpack provides curated color palettes designed for generative art and data visualization. This is a work-in-progress port of the original R package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install artpack-py
```

## Development Status

üöß **Work in Progress** - Currently porting core functionality from the R version. More features coming soon!

**Currently implemented:**

- ‚úÖ Color palette generation (`art_pals()`)
- ‚úÖ 100% test coverage
- ‚úÖ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

üõ£Ô∏è **Roadmap:**

- Additional color palette tools (Functions that help with color-related tasks.)
- Asset creation (Functions that help with making data for generative art.)
- Geometric testing tools (Functions that help with geometric/spatial analysis for generative art.)
- Grouping tools (Functions that help with grouping generative art data.)
- Sequencing tools (Functions that help with numeric sequencing.)
- Transformation tools (Functions that help with transforming existing generative art data.)
